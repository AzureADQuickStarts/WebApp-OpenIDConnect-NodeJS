// Passport session setup. (Section 2)

//   To support persistent login sessions, Passport needs to be able to
//   serialize users into and deserialize users out of the session.  Typically,
//   this will be as simple as storing the user ID when serializing, and finding
//   the user by ID when deserializing.


// Use the OIDCStrategy within Passport. (Section 2) 
// 
//   Strategies in passport require a `validate` function, which accept
//   credentials (in this case, an OpenID identifier), and invoke a callback
//   with a user object.



// configure Express (Section 2)



//Routes (Section 4)



// Our POST routes (Section 3)


// POST /auth/openid/return
//   Use passport.authenticate() as route middleware to authenticate the
//   request.  If authentication fails, the user will be redirected back to the
//   login page.  Otherwise, the primary route function function will be called,
//   which, in this example, will redirect the user to the home page.



// Simple route middleware to ensure user is authenticated. (Section 4)

//   Use this route middleware on any resource that needs to be protected.  If
//   the request is authenticated (typically via a persistent login session),
//   the request will proceed.  Otherwise, the user will be redirected to the
//   login page.
