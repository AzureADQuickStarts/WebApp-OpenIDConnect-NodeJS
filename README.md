# Azure Active Directory OIDC Web Sample

## THIS REPO IS A FORK OF THE CODE AT https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/WebApp-OpenIDConnect-NodeJS, but with the addition of cookie-session support (as opposed to server-side support).

This sample demonstrates how to set up OpenId Connect authentication in a web application built using Node.js with Express. The sample is designed to run on any platform.

## Prerequisites

To run this sample you will need the following:

* Install Node.js from http://nodejs.org/

* An Azure AD tenant. If you're not sure what a tenant is or how you would get one, read [How to get an Azure AD tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-howto-tenant).

## Register the sample in your Azure AD tenant

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

1. On the top bar, click on your account, and then on **Switch Directory**. Once the *Directory + subscription* pane opens, choose the Active Directory tenant where you wish to register your application.

1. Click on **All services** in the left-hand nav, and choose **Azure Active Directory**.

1. Click on **App registrations** and choose **New application registration**.

1. Enter a friendly name for the application, for example 'Webapp-Openidconnect' and select 'Web app / API' as the *Application Type*.

1. For the *sign-on URL*, enter the base URL for this sample which is `http://localhost:3000/`.

1. Click **Create** to create the application.

1. In the succeeding page, Find the *Application ID* value and record it for later. You'll need it to configure the client ID in the application.

1. Under **Settings**, choose **Properties** and update the App ID URI which is a unique identifier for your app. It is of the format 'https://<your_tenant_name>/<app_name>' replacing `<your_tenant_name>` with the name of your Azure AD tenant. For example: `https://contoso.onmicrosoft.com/Webapp-Openidconnect`

1. Under **Settings**, click on **Reply URLs** and set it to `http://localhost:3000/auth/openid/return` which this sample uses by default.

1. From the **Settings** menu, choose **Keys** and add a new entry in the Password section:
   - Type a key description (for instance 'app secret'),
   - Select a key duration of either **In 1 year**, **In 2 years**, or **Never Expires**.
   - When you save this page, the key value will be displayed. Copy, and save the value in a safe location.
   - You'll need this key later to configure the client secret in the app. This key value will not be displayed again, nor retrievable by any other means, so record it as soon as it is visible from the Azure portal.

## Download the sample application and modules

Next, clone the sample repo and install the NPM modules.

From your shell or command line run:

* `$ git clone git@github.com:AzureADQuickStarts/WebApp-OpenIDConnect-NodeJS.git`

or

* `$ git clone https://github.com/AzureADQuickStarts/WebApp-OpenIDConnect-NodeJS.git`


From the project root directory, run the command:

* `$ npm install`   

## Configure the application

Provide the parameters in `exports.creds` in config.js as instructed.

* Update `<tenant_name>` in `exports.identityMetadata` with the Azure AD tenant name of the format \*.onmicrosoft.com.
* Update `exports.clientID` with the Application Id noted from app registration.
* Update `exports.clientSecret` with the Application key noted from app registration.
* Update `exports.redirectUrl` with the Reply URL noted from app registration.

**Optional configuration for production apps:**

* Update `exports.destroySessionUrl` in config.js, if you want to use a different `post_logout_redirect_uri`.

* Set `exports.useMongoDBSessionStore` in config.js to true, if you want to use use mongoDB or other [compatible session stores](https://github.com/expressjs/session#compatible-session-stores).
The default session store in this sample is `express-session`. Note that the default session store is not suitable for production.

* Update `exports.databaseUri`, if you want to use mongoDB session store and a different database URI.

* Update `exports.mongoDBSessionMaxAge`. Here you can specify how long you want to keep a session in mongoDB. The unit is second(s).

## Build and run the application

* Start mongoDB service. If you are using mongoDB session store in this app, you have to [install mongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) and start the service first. If you are using the default session store, you can skip this step.

* Run the app using the following command from your command line.

    ```
    $ node app.js
    ```

**Is the server output hard to understand?:** We use `bunyan` for logging in this sample. The console won't make much sense to you unless you also install bunyan and run the server like above but pipe it through the bunyan binary:

```
$ npm install -g bunyan

$ node app.js | bunyan
```

## You're done!

You will have a server successfully running on `http://localhost:3000`.
